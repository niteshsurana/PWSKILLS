    "A class is a user-defined blueprint or prototype from which objects are created. Classes provide a means of bundling data and functionality together. Creating a new class creates a new type of object, allowing new instances of that type to be made. Each class instance can have attributes attached to it for maintaining its state. Class instances can also have methods (defined by their class) for modifying their state.\n",

    "An Object is an instance of a Class. A class is like a blueprint while an instance is a copy of the class with actual values. For example, suppose Bike is a class then we can create objects like bike1, bike2, etc from the class. An object consists of state, behavior and identity.\n",

    "Let’s say you are making a program which stores information about cars. You will create a class of name Car and then create objects of different cars. When creating a class object, we pass different things to it. In the case of cars, it will be company model, year of manufacture, etc. So, inside the class, we need a function that can assign all the arguments passed while creating the object to the newly created object. Or you might want to print something whenever a new car is added to your program.\n",
